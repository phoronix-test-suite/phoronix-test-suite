<h1>Setup Overview</h1>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite supports Linux, Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, Solaris, Hurd, BSD, and other operating system environments. The only Linux distribution-specific code deals with the external dependencies support feature that are set by individual test profiles. If you are not running one of the supported Linux distributions, Solaris, BSD, or macOS, you may need to install a package manually (as instructed by the Phoronix Test Suite) in order for a test to run. An example of an external dependency would be GCC and the OpenGL Utility Toolkit being needed for test profiles that build an OpenGL benchmark from source-code.</p>
<p>Among the distributions where the Phoronix Test Suite has been officially tested include Ubuntu, Fedora, Mandriva / Mageia, Gentoo, PCLinuxOS, Arch Linux, Pardus, OpenSuSE, Optware, webOS, Zenwalk, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux, Debian, Mint, MEPIS, Alpine Linux, Void Linux, Intel Clear Linux, and Amazon Linux EC2.</p>
<p>Among the tested BSD distributions are FreeBSD, PC-BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, and DragonflyBSD. Tested Solaris distributions include OpenSolaris, Solaris Express 11, Oracle Solaris 11, OpenIndiana, Illumos, and Nexenta.</p>
<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>The only required dependency for the Phoronix Test Suite is PHP 5.3 or newer. On Linux distributions, the needed package is commonly called <em>php5-cli</em> or <em>php-cli</em> or <em>php7</em> or <em>php</em>. It is important to note that only PHP for the command-line is needed and not a web server (Apache) or other packages commonly associated with PHP and its usage by web-sites. The PHP5 version required is PHP 5.3+ and can also be found at <a href="http://www.php.net/">www.php.net</a>. PHP 7 is fully supported by the Phoronix Test Suite as well as HHVM.</p>

<p>For installing PHP on Windows, the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/web/platform/phponwindows.aspx">Microsoft Web Platform Installer</a> provides an automated alternative that will install PHP into the directory expected by Phoronix Test Suite. Users opting to install PHP manually must extract the files to <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\</em> or a subdirectory.</p>
<p>As part of the PHP requirement, the following PHP extensions are required and/or highly recommended in order to take advantage of the Phoronix Test Suite capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP DOM</strong> is needed for XML operations and must be installed for the Phoronix Test Suite to function.</li>
<li><strong>PHP ZIP</strong> is needed for file compression and decompression and specifically dealing with test profiles and suites obtained via OpenBenchmarking.org or when uploading such tests and suites.</li>
<li><strong>PHP OpenSSL</strong> is used for enabling HTTPS communication with Phoronix Test Suite / OpenBenchmarking.org servers.</li>
<li><strong>PHP GD</strong> is highly recommended for rendering of test data to JPEG and PNG image formats and is selectively used in other image operations.</li>
<li><strong>PHP Zlib</strong> is highly recommended for greater data compression when dealing with remote OpenBenchmarking.org assets.</li>
<li><strong>PHP PCNTL</strong> is used for multi-threaded system sensor monitoring support during the testing process and other threaded tasks by the Phoronix Test Suite module framework.</li>
<li><strong>PHP POSIX</strong> is used for reliably obtaining more system information in an efficient manner.</li>
<li><strong>PHP CURL</strong> is supported as an alternative networking library for improved network performance in downloading test files and other operations.</li>
<li><strong>PHP FPDF</strong> is used to generate PDF reports of test data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without all of these extensions, some capabilities of the Phoronix Test Suite will not be available. Many of these packages are enabled by default and do not require any additional installation steps on most Linux distributions, otherwise they are often found in the package vendor's repository.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>You may need to modify the <em>php.ini</em> file on your system in order to support uploading results to OpenBenchmarking.org or logging into your OpenBenchmarking.org account. The <em>allow_url_fopen</em>, <em>file_uploads</em>, and <em>allow_url_include</em> options must be set to true in the PHP configuration. See additional information in this <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showpost.php?p=32484&amp;postcount=4">Phoronix Forums support thread</a>.</p>
<p>Major updates to the Phoronix Test Suite are released on a quarterly basis. The latest stable and development versions of the Phoronix Test Suite are available at <a href="http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix-Test-Suite.com</a>. The Git repository where the latest Phoronix Test Suite code is provided is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite">GitHub.com/phoronix-test-suite</a> and can be cloned/pulled from the <em>https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite.git</em> repository location. The latest upstream development code is housed in the master tree while older Phoronix Test Suite releases are available in their respective Git branches based upon the release's code-name.</p>
<p>If building the PHP package from upstream sources, it should just be a matter of running <em>./configure</em> with the <em>--enable-zip</em> flag (all other requirements should be apart of the stock PHP configuration) to satisfy the PHP needs of the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<h2>File Structure</h2>
<p>If manually changing the location of the <em>phoronix-test-suite</em> launcher file, the <em>PTS_USER_PATH</em> environment variable must be adjusted inside the file to reflect the absolute location that leads to the root directory of the <em>pts</em> and <em>pts-core</em> folders. The <em>pts-core</em> directory contains the &quot;engine&quot; of the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<h2>Running Locally</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite can be simply extracted from the downloaded <em>.tar.gz</em> or <em>.zip</em> file or it can also be installed system-wide. If you just wish to run the Phoronix Test Suite without installing it, open a terminal and run <em>./phoronix-test-suite &lt;options&gt;</em> from the same directory.</p>
<h2>Generic Installation</h2>
<p>Running <em>install-sh</em> from the root directory of the Phoronix Test Suite will install the software for system-wide access. By default the <em>phoronix-test-suite</em> executable is in <em>/usr/bin/</em>, the Phoronix Test Suite files in <em>/usr/share/phoronix-test-suite/</em>, and the documentation in /<em>usr/share/doc/phoronix-test-suite/</em>. Root access is required. The default installation prefix is /usr/ but can be adjusted as the first argument (example: <em>install-sh /home/user/</em> to install the Phoronix Test Suite in your home directory).</p>
<h2>Debian/Ubuntu Installation</h2>
<p>Debian/Ubuntu users are able to follow the Generic Installation instructions or can obtain a Debian Package from the Phoronix Test Suite web-site. The package contains the <em>phoronix-test-suite</em> executable in <em>/usr/bin/</em>, the Phoronix Test Suite files in <em>/usr/share/phoronix-test-suite/</em>, and the documentation in <em>/usr/share/doc/phoronix-test-suite/</em>.</p>
<h2>Fedora / Red Hat Installation</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite can be installed on Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS systems using the generic installation method. Alternatively, a <em>phoronix-test-suite</em> package is available in recent versions of the Fedora repository and in the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. However, at times this package may be out-of-date compared to upstream stable.</p>
<h2>Gentoo Installation</h2>
<p>Gentoo ebuild's for the Phoronix Test Suite have been created by users and can be currently found in the <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216656">Gentoo BugZilla</a>.</p>
<h2>Mandriva Installation</h2>
<p>Phoronix Test Suite packages are available through Mandriva Cooker starting with the Mandriva Linux 2009 release.</p>
<h2>OpenSolaris Installation</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite core (pts-core) is supported on Solaris and OpenSolaris platforms, but some features may not fully function. Additionally, the PTS External Dependencies feature is supported on OpenSolaris using IPS (the Image Packaging System). However, not all test profiles are supported on Solaris / OpenSolaris, and it may be in violation of your end-user agreement to perform such benchmarks on the Sun Solaris operating system. Using the OpenSolaris Image Packaging System, installing <em>SUNWphp524</em> will provide PHP, PHP GD, and related dependencies. The Phoronix Test Suite has also been tested on Oracle Solaris 11 Express, OpenIndiana, StormOS, and Nexenta Core Platform.</p>
<h2>BSD Installation</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite also supports *BSD operating systems. However, like the Solaris support, not all test profiles are compatible with BSD operating systems, but pts-core has been tested against FreeBSD 7.x/8.x/9.x, NetBSD, PC-BSD 7/8/9, DragonFlyBSD 3.0/3.2/3.4/3.6/4.2, and OpenBSD 4.4/4.6. The Phoronix Test Suite will also work with Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.</p>
<p>For DragonFlyBSD, it's a matter of just using <em>pkg_radd</em> with php5, php5-json, php5-dom, and php5-zip or <em>pkgsrc</em>. With DragonFlyBSD using dports, the command is <em>pkg install php5 php5-dom php5-zip php5-json php5-simplexml</em>. Under FreeBSD/PC-BSD, PHP can be obtained from the <em>php5</em> and <em>php5-extensions</em> Ports collection.</p>
<h2>MacOS Installation</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite is fully supported on Apple's macOS operating system. PHP ships with macOS by default so it's simply a matter of downloading the Phoronix Test Suite package, extracting it, and running the executable. For tests that rely upon a compiler, Apple's XCode with GCC and LLVM can be utilized.</p>
<h2>Windows Installation</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite support on Microsoft Windows is in development and will function just fine, but is not yet feature complete compared to the other operating systems support. Only a small subset of test profiles, mostly related to graphics, are supported. In terms of the version support, right now the Phoronix Test Suite is developed and tested solely against Microsoft Windows 7 x64 and Microsoft Windows 8 x64.</p>
<p>At this time the Phoronix Test Suite client is dependent upon the <em>php.exe</em> executable being installed to <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\ </em> or one of its subdirectories (see PHP installation notes above). Once this requirement is met, simply download the Phoronix Test Suite package, extract it to a directory of your choice, and run <em>phoronix-test-suite.bat</em></p>
<p>NOTE: because of lack of external dependencies support, it is necessary to manually download and install the files for some test profiles, such as the Unigine graphics benchmarks. See Troubleshooting for more information.</p>
<h2>Facebook HipHop</h2>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite can use Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php">HipHop HHVM</a> virtual machine as an alternative to the de facto PHP implementation. The Phoronix Test Suite has been tested against HHVM 2.0. If HHVM is present on the system but not PHP, it will automatically be used by the Phoronix Test Suite. Alternatively, the <em>PHP_BIN</em> environment variable can be set to point to an alternative <em>hhvm</em> binary.</p>
<p>The Phoronix Test Suite also supports the older version of Facebook HipHop that serves as a PHP to C++ translator and compiler with GCC. This support though is primitive and not officially supported. To compile the Phoronix Test Suite using HipHop/GCC, run <em>find . -name "*.php" > files.list && hphp --input-list=files.list -k 1 --log=3 --include-path="." --cluster-count=50 -v "AllDynamic=true" -v "AllVolatile=true"</em> from the root <em>phoronix-test-suite/</em> directory. It can then be executed in the form of <em>/tmp/hphp_XXX/program -f pts-core/phoronix-test-suite.php system-info</em>.</p>
