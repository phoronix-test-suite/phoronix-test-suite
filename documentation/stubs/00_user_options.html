<p>The following options are currently supported by the Phoronix Test Suite client. A list of available options can also be found by running <em>phoronix-test-suite help.</em><hr></p>
<h1>Test Installation</h1>
<h3>force-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will force the installation (or re-installation) of a test or suite. The arguments and process is similar to the install option but even if the test is installed, the entire installation process will automatically be executed. This option is generally used when debugging a test installation problem.</p>
<h3>install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) inside the testing environment directory. The install process from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. The install option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. Optionally, a OpenBenchmarking.org ID or the name of a saved results file can be supplied as well and the test(s) to install will automatically be extracted from that information. If the test is already installed and was run by the latest version of the installation process, no action will be taken. Multiple arguments can be supplied to install additional tests at the same time.</p>
<h3>install-dependencies<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the external dependencies needed by the selected test(s) using the distribution's package management system. For example, some tests depend upon GCC for compiling code. If GCC is not detected on the system, the Phoronix Test Suite will attempt to install GCC using the distribution's package management system. If you are running this command as a local user, you may be prompted for the root password while the process is running. For unsupported distributions, the dependency names will be displayed along with common names for the package. The install-dependencies option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. When using the install option, the external dependencies are automatically checked.</p>
<h3>make-download-cache<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option will create a download cache for use by the Phoronix Test Suite. The download cache is created of test files already downloaded to the local system. If passing any test/suite names to make-download-cache, the needed files for those test profiles will first be automatically downloaded before creating the cache.</p>
<h3>remove-installed-test<em>  [Test]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will permanently remove a installed test by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<h1>Testing</h1>
<h3>auto-compare<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option will autonomously determine the most relevant test(s) to run for any selected sub-system(s). The tests to run are determined via OpenBenchmarking.org integration with the global results pool. Related test results from OpenBenchmarking.org are also merged to provide a straight-forward and effective means of carrying out a system comparison. If wishing to find comparable results for any particular test profile(s), simply pass the test profile names as additional arguments to this command.</p>
<h3>benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s). This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the run option. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results into one file.</p>
<h3>estimate-run-time<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will provide estimates for test run-time / length.</p>
<h3>finish-run<em>  [Test Result]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option can be used if a test run had not properly finished running all tests within a saved results file. Using this option when specifying a saved results file where all tests had not completed will attempt to finish testing on the remaining tests where there are missing results.</p>
<h3>run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s).</p>
<h3>run-random-tests<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option will query OpenBenchmarking.org to run random benchmarks and result comparisons on the system. This test can be used for simply supplying interesting results from your system onto OpenBenchmarking.org, stressing your system with random workloads, seeding new OpenBenchmarking.org results, etc. Basic options are provided at start-up for tuning the randomness of the testing when running this command.</p>
<h3>run-tests-in-suite<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option can be used if you wish to run all of the tests found in a supplied suite, but you wish to re-configure each of the test options rather than using the defaults supplied by the suite.</p>
<h3>stress-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the passed tests/suites in the multi-process stress-testing mode. The stress-run mode will not produce a result file but is rather intended for running multiple test profiles concurrently to stress / burn-in the system. The number of tests to run concurrently can be toggled via the PTS_CONCURRENT_TEST_RUNS environment variable and by default is set to a value of 2.</p>
<h1>Batch Testing</h1>
<h3>batch-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the benchmark option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>
<h3>batch-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>If you wish to run the install process in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode but do not wish to run any tests at this time. Running the install process in the batch mode will use the default values and not prompt the user of any possible options, to ensure the process is fully automated.</p>
<h3>batch-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the run option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>
<h3>batch-setup<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option is used to configure the batch mode options for the Phoronix Test Suite, which is subsequently written to the user configuration file. Among the options are whether to automatically upload the test results to OpenBenchmarking.org and prompting for the saved file name.</p>
<h3>default-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s) in the defaults mode. This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the default-run option.</p>
<h3>default-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the test or suite must be supplied or the OpenBenchmarking.org ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion. Unlike the normal run option, the default-run will not prompt the user to select from the available test options but will instead use the default options as automatically set by pts-core or the test profile. Use batch-run to automatically test all of the available options.</p>
<h3>internal-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments pre-set the Phoronix Test Suite batch run mode with sane values for carrying out benchmarks in a semi-automated manner and without uploading any of the result data to the public OpenBenchmarking.org.</p>
<h1>OpenBenchmarking.org</h1>
<h3>clone-result<em>  [OpenBenchmarking ID]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will download a local copy of a file that was saved to OpenBenchmarking.org, as long as a valid public ID is supplied.</p>
<h3>list-recommended-tests<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option will list recommended test profiles for benchmarking sorted by hardware sub-system. The recommended tests are determined via querying OpenBenchmarking.org and determining the most popular tests for a given environment based upon the number of times a test profile has been downloaded, the number of test results available on OpenBenchmarking.org for a given test profile, the age of the test profile, and other weighted factors.</p>
<h3>make-openbenchmarking-cache<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option will attempt to cache the test profile/suite meta-data from OpenBenchmarking.org for all linked repositories. This is useful if you're going to be running the Phoronix Test Suite / Phoromatic behind a firewall or without any Internet connection. Those with unrestricted Internet access or not utilizing a large local deployment of the Phoronix Test Suite / Phoromatic shouldn't need to run this command.</p>

</h3>
<p>This option will list recent changes to test profiles of enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p>
<h3>openbenchmarking-login<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option is used for controlling your Phoronix Test Suite client options for OpenBechmarking.org and syncing the client to your account.</p>
<h3>openbenchmarking-refresh<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option is used for refreshing the stored OpenBenchmarking.org repostory information and other data. The Phoronix Test Suite will automatically refresh this data every three days or when other thresholds are exceeded, but this command can be used to manually refresh/updates the data.</p>
<h3>openbenchmarking-repositories<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>This option will list the OpenBenchmarking.org repositories currently linked to this Phoronix Test Suite client instance.</p>
