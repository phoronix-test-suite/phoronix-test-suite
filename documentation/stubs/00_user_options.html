<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><title>User Options</title></head><body><p>The following options are currently supported by the Phoronix Test Suite client. A list of available options can also be found by running <em>phoronix-test-suite help.</em><hr></p><h1>Test Installation</h1><h3>install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will install the selected test(s) inside the testing environment directory). The install process from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. The install option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. Optionally, a OpenBenchmarking.org ID or the name of a saved results file can be supplied as well and the test(s) to install will automatically be extracted from that information. If the test is already installed and was run by the latest version of the installation process, no action will be taken. Multiple arguments can be supplied to install additional tests at the same time.</p><h3>install-dependencies<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will install the external dependencies needed by the selected test(s) using the distribution's package management system. For example, some tests depend upon GCC for compiling code. If GCC is not detected on the system, the Phoronix Test Suite will attempt to install GCC using the distribution's package management system. If you are running this command as a local user, you may be prompted for the root password while the process is running. For unsupported distributions, the dependency names will be displayed along with common names for the package. The install-dependencies option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. When using the install option, the external dependencies are automatically checked.</p><h3>make-download-cache<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will create a download cache for use by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p><h3>remove-installed-test<em>  [Test]</em></h3><p>This option will permanently remove a installed test by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p><h1>Testing</h1><h3>auto-compare<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will autonomously determine the most relevant test(s) to run for any selected sub-system(s). The tests to run are determined via OpenBenchmarking.org integration with the global results pool. Related test results from OpenBenchmarking.org are also merged to provide a straight-forward and effective means of carrying out a system comparison. If wishing to find comparable results for any particular test profile(s), simply pass the test profile names as additional arguments to this command.</p><h3>benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s). This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the run option. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results into one file.</p><h3>finish-run<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option can be used if a test run had not properly finished running all tests within a saved results file. Using this option when specifying a saved results file where all tests had not completed will attempt to finish testing on the remaining tests where there are missing results.</p><h3>run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will run the selected test(s).</p><h3>run-tests-in-suite<em>  </em></h3><p>This option can be used if you wish to run all of the tests found in a supplied suite, but you wish to re-configure each of the test options rather than using the defaults supplied by the suite.</p><h1>Batch Testing</h1><h3>batch-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the benchmark option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p><h3>batch-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>If you wish to run the install process in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode but do not wish to run any tests at this time. Running the install process in the batch mode will use the default values and not prompt the user of any possible options, to ensure the process is fully automated.</p><h3>batch-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the run option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p><h3>batch-setup<em>  </em></h3><p>This option is used to configure the batch mode options for the Phoronix Test Suite, which is subsequently written to the user configuration file. Among the options are whether to automatically upload the test results to OpenBenchmarking.org and prompting for the saved file name.</p><h3>default-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s) in the defaults mode. This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the default-run option.</p><h3>default-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the test or suite must be supplied or the OpenBenchmarking.org ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion. Unlike the normal run option, the default-run will not prompt the user to select from the available test options but will instead use the default options as automatically set by pts-core or the test profile. Use batch-run to automatically test all of the available options.</p><h3>internal-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option and its arguments pre-set the Phoronix Test Suite batch run mode with sane values for carrying out benchmarks in a semi-automated manner and without uploading any of the result data to the public OpenBenchmarking.org.</p><h1>OpenBenchmarking.org</h1><h3>clone-result<em>  [OpenBenchmarking ID]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will download a local copy of a file that was saved to OpenBenchmarking.org, as long as a valid public ID is supplied. More than one ID can be specified and the results will then be merged.</p><h3>list-recommended-tests<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list recommended test profiles for benchmarking sorted by hardware sub-system. The recommended tests are determined via querying OpenBenchmarking.org and determining the most popular tests for a given environment based upon the number of times a test profile has been downloaded, the number of test results available on OpenBenchmarking.org for a given test profile, the age of the test profile, and other weighted factors.</p><h3>openbenchmarking-changes<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list recent changes to test profiles of enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p><h3>openbenchmarking-launcher<em>  </em></h3><p>This option is called automatically with the .openbenchmarking MIME file extension support for launching OpenBenchmarking.org operations.</p><h3>openbenchmarking-login<em>  </em></h3><p>This option is used for controlling your Phoronix Test Suite client options for OpenBechmarking.org and syncing the client to your account.</p><h3>openbenchmarking-refresh<em>  </em></h3><p>This option is used for refreshing the stored OpenBenchmarking.org repostory information and other data. The Phoronix Test Suite will automatically refresh this data every three days or when other thresholds are exceeded, but this command can be used to manually refresh/updates the data.</p><h3>openbenchmarking-repositories<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list the OpenBenchmarking.org repositories currently linked to this Phoronix Test Suite client instance.</p><h3>upload-result<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option is used for uploading a test result to OpenBenchmarking.org.</p><h3>upload-test-profile<em>  </em></h3><p>This option can be used for uploading a test profile to your account on OpenBenchmarking.org. By uploading your test profile to OpenBenchmarking.org, others are then able to browse and access this test suite for easy distribution in a seamless manner by other Phoronix Test Suite clients.</p><h3>upload-test-suite<em>  </em></h3><p>This option can be used for uploading a test suite to your account on OpenBenchmarking.org. By uploading your test suite to OpenBenchmarking.org, others are then able to browse and access this test suite for easy distribution.</p><h1>System</h1><h3>detailed-system-info<em>  </em></h3><p>Display detailed information about the installed system hardware and software information as detected by the Phoronix Test Suite Phodevi Library.</p><h3>diagnostics<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will print information that is useful to developers when debugging problems with the Phoronix Test Suite and/or test profiles and test suites.</p><h3>interactive<em>  </em></h3><p>A simple text-driven interactive interface to the Phoronix Test Suite.</p><h3>system-info<em>  </em></h3><p>Display the installed system hardware and software information as detected by the Phoronix Test Suite Phodevi Library.</p><h3>system-sensors<em>  </em></h3><p>Display the installed system hardware and software sensors in real-time as detected by the Phoronix Test Suite Phodevi Library.</p><h1>Information</h1><h3>info<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will show details about the supplied test, suite, virtual suite, or result file.</p><h3>list-available-suites<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all test suites that are available from the enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p><h3>list-available-tests<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all test profiles that are available from the enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p><h3>list-available-virtual-suites<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all available virtual test suites that can be dynamically created based upon the available tests from enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p><h3>list-installed-dependencies<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all of the packages / external test dependencies that are already installed on the system that the Phoronix Test Suite may potentially depend upon by test profiles.</p><h3>list-installed-suites<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all suites that are currently installed on the system.</p><h3>list-installed-tests<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all test profiles that are currently installed on the system.</p><h3>list-missing-dependencies<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all of the packages / external test dependencies that are missing from the system that the Phoronix Test Suite may potentially need by select test profiles.</p><h3>list-possible-dependencies<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all of the packages / external test dependencies that are are potentially used by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p><h3>list-saved-results<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all of the saved test results found on the system.</p><h3>list-test-usage<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list various details about installed tests and their usage.</p><h3>list-unsupported-tests<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will list all available test profiles that are available from the enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories but are NOT SUPPORTED on the given hardware/software platform. This is mainly a debugging option for those looking for test profiles to potentially port to new platforms, etc.</p><h1>Asset Creation</h1><h3>debug-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option is intended for use by test profile writers and is identical to the install option but will yield more information during the run process that can be used to debug issues with a test profile installer or to verify the test profile is functioning correctly.</p><h3>debug-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option is intended for use by test profile writers and is identical to the &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; option but will yield more information during the run process that can be used to debug issues with a test profile or to verify the test profile is functioning correctly.</p><h3>debug-test-download-links<em>  [Test | Suite]</em></h3><p>This option will check all download links within the specified test profile(s) to ensure there are no broken URLs.</p><h3>download-test-files<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This will download the selected test file(s) to the Phoronix Test Suite download cache but will not install the tests.</p><h3>force-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...</em></h3><p>This option will force the installation (or re-installation) of a test or suite. The arguments and process is similar to the install option but even if the test is installed, the entire installation process will automatically be executed. This option is generally used when debugging a test installation problem.</p><h3>result-file-to-suite<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will guide the user through the process of generating their own test suite, which they can then run, that is based upon an existing test results file.</p><h3>validate-result-file<em>  </em></h3><p>This option can be used for validating a Phoronix Test Suite result file as being compliant against the OpenBenchmarking.org specification.</p><h3>validate-test-profile<em>  </em></h3><p>This option can be used for validating a Phoronix Test Suite test profile as being compliant against the OpenBenchmarking.org specification.</p><h3>validate-test-suite<em>  </em></h3><p>This option can be used for validating a Phoronix Test Suite test suite as being compliant against the OpenBenchmarking.org specification.</p><h1>Result Management</h1><h3>copy-run-in-result-file<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option is used if you wish to change an existing test run within a saved results file.</p><h3>extract-from-result-file<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will extract a single set of test results from a saved results file that contains multiple test results that have been merged.

The CSV (Comma Separated Values) output can then be loaded into a spreadsheet for easy viewing.</p><h3>result-file-to-pdf<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will read a saved test results file and output the system hardware and software information along with the results to a PDF file.</p><h3>result-file-to-text<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will read a saved test results file and output the system hardware and software information to the terminal. The test results are also outputted.</p><h3>show-result<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>Open up the test results in the Phoronix Test Suite Result Viewer or on OpenBenchmarking.org.</p><h1>Result Analytics</h1><h3>analyze-all-runs<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will generate a candlestick graph showing the distribution of results from all trial runs. The candlestick graph is similar to the Japanese candlestick charts used by the financial industry, except instead of representing stock data it is numerical result data from all trial runs.\n\nThe tip of the upper-wick represents the highest value of the test runs with the tip of the lower-wick representing the lowest value of all test runs. The upper-edge of the candle body represents the first or last run value and the lower-edge represents the first or last run value. Lastly, if the last run value is less than the first run value, the candle body is the same color as the graph background, otherwise the last run value is greater.</p><h3>analyze-batch<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will analyze a batch results file and plot out the performance impact from the different options onto a line graph (i.e. to see the impact that changing the video resolution has on the system's performance).</p><h3>analyze-image-delta<em>  [Test Result]</em></h3><p>This option will analyze a test result file if it contains any test results that produced an image quality comparison (IQC) and will render image deltas illustrating the difference between images from two test results.</p><h1>Other</h1><h3>build-suite<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will guide the user through the process of generating their own test suite, which they can then run. Optionally, passed as arguments can be the test(s) or suite(s) to add to the suite to be created, instead of being prompted through the process.</p><h3>debug-self-test<em>  </em></h3><p>This option is used during the development of the Phoronix Test Suite software for testing of internal interfaces, commands, and other common code-paths. The produced numbers should only be comparable for the same version of the Phoronix Test Suite, on the same hardware/software system, conducted on the same day of testing. This isn't intended as any scientific benchmark but simply to stress common PHP code-paths and looking for hot areas to optimize, etc.</p><h3>help<em>  </em></h3><p>This option will display the list of available Phoronix Test Suite commands.</p><h3>network-setup<em>  </em></h3><p>This option allows the user to configure how the Phoronix Test Suite connects to OpenBenchmarking.org and other web-services.
