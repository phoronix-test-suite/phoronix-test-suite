<p>The following options are currently supported by the Phoronix Test Suite client. A list of available options can also be found by running <em>phoronix-test-suite help.</em><hr></p>
<h1>System</h1>
<h3>interactive</h3>
<p>A simple text-driven interactive interface to the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<h3>php-conf</h3>
<p>This option will print information that is useful to developers when debugging problems with the Phoronix Test Suite and/or test profiles and test suites.</p>
<h3>shell</h3>
<p>A simple text-driven shell interface / helper to the Phoronix Test Suite. Ideal for those that may be new to the Phoronix Test Suite</p>
<h3>system-info</h3>
<p>Display the installed system hardware and software information as detected by the Phoronix Test Suite Phodevi Library.</p>
<h3>system-properties</h3>
<p>Display various hardware/software system properties detected by the Phoronix Device Interface (Phodevi) library.</p>
<h3>system-sensors</h3>
<p>Display the installed system hardware and software sensors in real-time as detected by the Phoronix Test Suite Phodevi Library.</p>
<h1>Test Installation</h1>
<h3>force-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will force the installation (or re-installation) of a test or suite. The arguments and process is similar to the install option but even if the test is installed, the entire installation process will automatically be executed. This option is generally used when debugging a test installation problem or wishing to re-install test(s) due to compiler or other environmental changes.</p>
<h3>install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) inside the testing environment directory. The install process from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. The install option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. Optionally, a OpenBenchmarking.org ID or the name of a saved results file can be supplied as well and the test(s) to install will automatically be extracted from that information. If the test is already installed and was run by the latest version of the installation process, no action will be taken. Multiple arguments can be supplied to install additional tests at the same time.</p>
<h3>install-dependencies<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the external dependencies needed by the selected test(s) using the distribution's package management system. For example, some tests depend upon GCC for compiling code. If GCC is not detected on the system, the Phoronix Test Suite will attempt to install GCC using the distribution's package management system. If you are running this command as a local user, you may be prompted for the root password while the process is running. For unsupported distributions, the dependency names will be displayed along with common names for the package. The install-dependencies option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. When using the install option, the external dependencies are automatically checked.</p>
<h3>make-download-cache</h3>
<p>This option will create a download cache for use by the Phoronix Test Suite. The download cache is created of test files already downloaded to the local system. If passing any test/suite names to make-download-cache, the needed files for those test profiles will first be automatically downloaded before creating the cache.</p>
<h3>remove-installed-test<em>  [Test]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will permanently remove a installed test by the Phoronix Test Suite.</p>
<h1>Testing</h1>
<h3>benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s). This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the run option. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results into one file.</p>
<h3>estimate-install-time<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will provide estimates for test install/setup time length.</p>
<h3>estimate-run-time<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will provide estimates for test run-time / length.</p>
<h3>finish-run<em>  [Test Result]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option can be used if a test run had not properly finished running all tests within a saved results file. Using this option when specifying a saved results file where all tests had not completed will attempt to finish / resume testing on the remaining tests where there are missing results to be completed.</p>
<h3>run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s).</p>
<h3>run-random-tests</h3>
<p>This option will query OpenBenchmarking.org to run random benchmarks and result comparisons on the system. This test can be used for simply supplying interesting results from your system onto OpenBenchmarking.org, stressing your system with random workloads, seeding new OpenBenchmarking.org results, etc. Basic options are provided at start-up for tuning the randomness of the testing when running this command.</p>
<h3>run-subset<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s) but prompt the user when passing any test suites or result files what subset / test(s) contained within there to run rather than running all passed tests/suites/results.</p>
<h3>run-tests-in-suite<em>  [Suite]</em>
</h3>
<p>This option can be used if you wish to run all of the tests found in a supplied suite, but you wish to re-configure each of the test options rather than using the defaults supplied by the suite.</p>
<h3>stress-batch-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the passed tests/suites in the multi-process stress-testing mode while behaving by the Phoronix Test Suite batch testing characteristics. The stress-batch-run mode is similar to the stress-run command except that for any tests passed to it will run all combinations of the options rather than prompting the user for the values to be selected.</p>
<h3>stress-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the passed tests/suites in the multi-process stress-testing mode. The stress-run mode will not produce a result file but is rather intended for running multiple test profiles concurrently to stress / burn-in the system. The number of tests to run concurrently can be toggled via the PTS_CONCURRENT_TEST_RUNS environment variable and by default is set to a value of 2.</p>
<h3>strict-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option is equivalent to the `benchmark` option except it enables various options to run benchmarks an extended number of times for ensuring better statistical accuracy if enforcing strict controls over the data quality, in some cases running the benchmarks for 20+ times.</p>
<h3>strict-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option is equivalent to the `run` option except it enables various options to run benchmarks an extended number of times for ensuring better statistical accuracy if enforcing strict controls over the data quality, in some cases running the benchmarks for 20+ times.</p>
<h1>Batch Testing</h1>
<h3>batch-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the benchmark option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>
<h3>batch-install<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>If you wish to run the install process in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode but do not wish to run any tests at this time. Running the install process in the batch mode will use the default values and not prompt the user of any possible options, to ensure the process is fully automated.</p>
<h3>batch-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments are equivalent to the run option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>
<h3>batch-setup</h3>
<p>This option is used to configure the batch mode options for the Phoronix Test Suite, which is subsequently written to the user configuration file. Among the options are whether to automatically upload the test results to OpenBenchmarking.org and prompting for the saved file name.</p>
<h3>default-benchmark<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s) in the defaults mode. This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the default-run option.</p>
<h3>default-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the test or suite must be supplied or the OpenBenchmarking.org ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion. Unlike the normal run option, the default-run will not prompt the user to select from the available test options but will instead use the default options as automatically set by pts-core or the test profile. Use batch-run to automatically test all of the available options.</p>
<h3>dry-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments pre-set the Phoronix Test Suite batch run mode with enforcing of defaults to not save any results and other behavior intended for a dry/test run. This option is primarily intended for testing/evaluation purposes.</p>
<h3>internal-run<em>  [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option and its arguments pre-set the Phoronix Test Suite batch run mode with sane values for carrying out benchmarks in a semi-automated manner and without uploading any of the result data to the public OpenBenchmarking.org.</p>
<h1>OpenBenchmarking.org</h1>
<h3>clone-result<em>  [OpenBenchmarking ID]  ...</em>
</h3>
<p>This option will download a local copy of a file that was saved to OpenBenchmarking.org, as long as a valid public ID is supplied.</p>
<h3>dump-suites-to-git</h3>
<p>This option will create a Git repository of OpenBenchmarking.org test suites.</p>
<h3>dump-tests-to-git</h3>
<p>This option will create a Git repository of OpenBenchmarking.org test profiles.</p>
<h3>enable-repo</h3>
<p>This option is used if wanting to add a new OpenBenchmarking.org account/repository to your system for enabling third-party/unofficial test profiles and test suites.</p>
<h3>list-recommended-tests</h3>
<p>This option will list recommended test profiles for benchmarking sorted by hardware sub-system. The recommended tests are determined via querying OpenBenchmarking.org and determining the most popular tests for a given environment based upon the number of times a test profile has been downloaded, the number of test results available on OpenBenchmarking.org for a given test profile, the age of the test profile, and other weighted factors.</p>
<h3>make-openbenchmarking-cache</h3>
<p>This option will attempt to cache the test profile/suite meta-data from OpenBenchmarking.org for all linked repositories. This is useful if you're going to be running the Phoronix Test Suite / Phoromatic behind a firewall or without any Internet connection. Those with unrestricted Internet access or not utilizing a large local deployment of the Phoronix Test Suite / Phoromatic shouldn't need to run this command.</p>
<h3>ob-test-profile-analyze</h3>
<p>This option is intended for test profile creators and generates a range of meta-data and other useful information that can be submitted to OpenBenchmarking.org to provide more verbose information for users of your test profiles.</p>

<h3>list-all-tests</h3>
<p>This option will list all test profiles that are available from the enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories. Unlike the other test listing options, list-all-tests will show deprecated tests, potentially broken tests, or other tests not recommended for all environments. The only check in place is ensuring the test profiles are at least compatible with the operating system in use.</p>
<h3>list-available-suites</h3>
<p>This option will list all test suites that are available from the enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p>
<h3>list-available-tests</h3>
<p>This option will list all test profiles that are available from the enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories where supported on the system and are of a verified state. If the system has no Internet access, it will only list the test profiles where the necessary test assets are available locally on the system or on an available network cache (the same behavior as using the list-cached-tests sub-command), unless using the list-all-tests option to override this behavior.</p>
